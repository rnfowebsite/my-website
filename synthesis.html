				<h2> Health </h2>
				
					<div class="sythesis">
					<p>
					Healthcare is a wide and constantly developing field that aims to understand diseases improve treatments and promote overall wellbeing. It explores both physical and mental health by studying the causes of illnesses. Through these studies researchers learn how diseases begin and progress which helps them create better treatments and develop new medical technologies. Health research also explains how prevention works by studying public health measures early detection and lifestyle practices that can lower the risk of illness.
					</p>
					
					<p>
					Aside from studying illnesses health research also examines factors that influence overall wellbeing such as mental health nutrition physical activity and the environment. It explains how stress diet pollution and climate conditions affect people in different communities. Research on healthcare systems and policies helps show how healthcare can be improved by focusing on the quality and availability of services and by understanding why certain groups experience poorer health due to social and economic conditions.
					</p>
					
					<p>
					In conclusion healthcare research used many scientific methods including clinical trial surveys and laboratory studies to produce reliable and viable information that guides medical practice. It depends on the cooperation of scientists healthcare workers and institutions to turn research findings into real solutions that can improve human health and make healthcare more effective for everyone.

				<h2> Education </h2>
				
					<div class="sythesis">
					<p>
					     Innovation in education today has changed the way people learn because information is more accessible through the internet and AI. Students can now search for answers, explore new topics, and use learning tools that support their studies anytime. AI also helps by giving quick explanations, personalized feedback, and easier access to resources. Though there are risks like misinformation or overdependence, these tools are still beneficial when used properly. This is why schools must guide students on how to use AI responsibly so that they can learn effectively and stay safe online.
					</p>
					
					<p>
					Because of these changes, education now focuses not only on teaching lessons but also on helping students develop digital literacy and critical thinking. Teachers are encouraged to combine technology with traditional methods so learning becomes more engaging and inclusive. As long as students understand the proper use of these tools, innovation can continue to support better learning opportunities for everyone.

				<h2> Sustainable Cities </h2>
				
					<div class="sythesis">
					<p>
					The 8th Research Congress at the University of Makati emphasized the importance of building sustainable cities through innovation, research, and collaboration. As urban areas continue to grow, the congress highlighted challenges such as overcrowding, environmental degradation, and uneven access to essential services. Speakers stressed that achieving sustainable cities requires smarter urban planning, resilient infrastructures, and solutions that address real community needs. The session on Education for Sustainable Cities also underscored that students must not only learn to survive in modern society but be empowered to transform it through design thinking and critical problem-solving. Overall, the congress showed that sustainable cities can only be achieved when education, technology, and community-centered research work together to create inclusive, resilient, and future-ready urban environments.
					</p>
					
					<p>
					In addition, the congress emphasized the role of interdisciplinary research in solving urban problems, showing how health, education, environment, and community development all connect to sustainable cities. Presentations on healthcare innovations such as telemedicine and AI-assisted diagnostics highlighted how technology can support densely populated cities by improving access and reducing inequality.
